 * SVG Path rounding function. Takes an input path string and outputs a path

 *
 * @param pathString The SVG input path
 * @param radius The amount to round the corners, either a value in the SVG
 *               coordinate space, or, if useFractionalRadius is true, a value
 *               from 0 to 1.
 * @param useFractionalRadius If true, the curve radius is expressed as a
 *               fraction of the distance between the point being curved and
 *               the previous and next points.
 * @returns A new SVG path string with the rounding
